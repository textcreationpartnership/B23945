            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT was intended that there should have been an Epistle Dedicatory of this Book: but while reason and honesty must be—, it is no time for such a Client to expect a Patron. It sheweth you what Commonwealths-Men say is that which could be done; expect greater things when others do what they cannot say. It may be thought, if you be a friend, cold comfort to tell you, that you shall have what you wish, when you can have nothing else; yet is this all, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. Security enough to you; and reason enough for me (how unseasonable soever it may be thought) to let go this Piece: in which I intreat you to correct the errours, as is shewn at the end, or at least to take notice of them there before you begin. In
<pb facs="tcp:199326:3"/> the mean time, whereas writings of this kind are not looked upon with a single eye, as men should look in reasoning, but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of them are looked upon with a single eye as men look in shooting; I am no enemy of Monarchists: if Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths-Men were no wiser then I, they should never be striven withall, but freely have the whole honour of ruining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; in this state of affairs, the certain end. At least, so am I confirmed in this point, that I exhort all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths-Men to seek peace and insue it, as the readiest way unto their own good; and you Reader to bear witness, that I am no incendiary nor mal-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but have spoken with Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Reason; which if this age fail me, shall be testifi'd by another. And so if I perish, I perish.</p>

Or do they not agree together upon such orders, unto which they consent equally to submit?

                        <p>Shewing the variation of the English Balance.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Lands in the hold of the Nobility and Clergy of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> till <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. cannot be esteemed to have over-balanced those in the hold of the people less then four to one. Whereas in our daies, the Clergy being destroyed, the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:199326:13"/> Lands in hold of the people over-ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance those in the hold of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, at the least nine in ten. In shewing how this change came about, some would have it that I assume unto my self more then my share; albeit they find not me delivering that which must rely upon authority, and not vouching my authours. But <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh being conscious of infirmity in his ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, yet finding with what strength and vigour he was brought in by the Nobility, conceived jealousies of like power in case of decay or change of affections. <hi>(Nondum orbis adorave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Romam.)</hi> The Lords yet led coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-lives, their houses were open to retainers, men experienced in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary affairs, and capable of leading; their hospitality was the delight of their Tenants, by their tenures or dependence obliged to follow their Lords in arms. So that this being the Militia of the Nation, a few Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men discontented could at any time levy a great Army; the effect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, both in the Barons Wars, and those of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> had been well known unto diverse Kings. This state of affairs was that at which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:199326:13"/>
                        <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh made advantage of troubled times, and frequent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruliness of retainers to take his aym, while under pretence of curbing riots, he obtained the passing of such Laws as cut off retainers, in which the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility lost their Officers. Then whereas the dependence of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon their Lords was of a strict tie or nature, he found means to loosen this also, by Laws which he obtained upon as fair a pretence, even that of population:<note place="margin">Verulam. H. 7.</note> thus <hi>Farmes were so brought unto a standard, that the houses being kept up, each of them did of necessity inforce a dweller; and the proportion of Land laid unto each house, did of necessity inforce that dweller not to be a beggar or cottager, but a man able to keep servants, and set the plough on going. By which means a great part of the Lands of this Nation came in effect to be amortized unto the hold of the Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manry or middle people,</hi> whereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted the main body of the Militia, hereby incredibly advanced, &amp; which henceforth <hi>like cleaner underwood less choaked by their staddles,</hi> began to grow exceedingly. But the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who by the former Laws had lost
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:199326:14"/> their Offices, by this lost their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery. Yet remained unto them their estates, till the same Prince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing the Statutes for Alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, these also became loose; and the Lords less taken (for the reasons shewn) with their Countrey-lives, where their trains were clipped, by degrees became Courtiers, where greater pompe and expence by the Statutes of Alienations began to plume them of their Estates. The Court was yet at <hi>Bridewell,</hi> nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <hi>London</hi> any farther then Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-bar. The latter growth of this City, and in that, the declining of the Balance unto popularity, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth from the decay of the Nobility, and of the Clergy. In the Reign of the succeeding King were Abbies (then which nothing more dwarfs a people) demolished. I did not, I do not attribute the effects of these things thus far unto my own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular observation, but alwaies did and do attribute a sense thereof un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the wisdom of her Council: There is yet living testimony, that the ruine of the English Monarchy, through the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:199326:14"/> causes mentioned, was frequently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed unto <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh by Sir <hi>Henry Wotton;</hi> which tradition is not unlike to have descended upon him from the Queens Council: But there is difference between having a sense of a thing, and making a right use of that sense. Let a man read <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the lives of <hi>Agis,</hi> and of the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> there can be no plainer demonstration of the Lacedemonian or Roman Balance; yet read his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Government in his Morals, and he hath forgotten it; he maketh no use, no mention at all of any such thing. Who could have been plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner upon this point then Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> where to prove that the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> were not elective but hereditary, he alledgeth that if the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> had been elective, <hi>The children of Pharaoh must have been more mighty then the King,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hist. of the World, part 1. p. 200.</note>
                        <hi>as Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords of all Egypt, and the King himself their tenant?</hi> Yet when he cometh to speak of Government, he hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard unto, no remembrance of any such principle. In Mr. <hi>Seldens</hi> Titles of Honour, he hath demonstrated the English Balance of the Peerage,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:199326:15"/> without making any application of it, or indeed perceiving it, there, or in times when the defect of the same came to give so full a sense of it. The like might be made apparent in <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> in <hi>Machiavil,</hi> in my Lord <hi>Verulam,</hi> in all, in any Politician; there is not one of them in whom may not be found as right a sense of this principle as in this present Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, or in whom may be found a righter use of it then was made by any of the parties thus far concerned in this story, or by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her Council. <hi>If a Prince</hi> (saith a great Authour) <hi>to reform a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were obliged to depose himself,</hi>

                        <hi>he might in neglecting of it, be capable of some excuse; but reformation of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment being that with which a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality may stand, he deserveth no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse at all.</hi> It is indeed not observed by this Authour, that where through declination of the Balance unto po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity, the State requireth refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the Superstructures, there the Prince cannot rightly reform, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less from Soveraign power he descend unto a Principality in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; nevertheless upon like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:199326:15"/> this faileth not to be found so in Nature and Experience. The growth of the people of <hi>England</hi> since the ruines mentioned of the Nobility and the Clergy, came in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to more then stood with the interest, or indeed the nature or possibility of well-founded or durable Monarchy; as was pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently perceived, but withall tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized, by her Council, who (if the truth of her Government be rightly weighed) seem rather to have put her upon the exercise of Principality in a Commonwealth, then of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power in a Monarchy. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that she courted not her No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, nor gave her mind, as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs seated upon the like order, to Balance her great men, or reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their power now inconsiderable; but ruled wholly (with an art she had unto high perfection) by humoring and blessing her people. For this but shadow of a Commonwealth, is she yet famous, and shall ever be; though had she introduced the full perfection of the orders requisite unto Popular Government; First, it had established such Principality unto her successors,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:199326:16"/> as they might have held. Secondly, this Principality (the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth (as <hi>Rome</hi> of <hi>Romulus</hi>) being borne of such a Parent) might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Royal Dignity and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue to the full,<note place="margin">The great Council of <hi>Venice</hi> hath the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign power, and the Duke the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</note> improved and discharged of all envy. Thirdly, it had saved all the bloud and confusion, which through this neglect in her, and her successours, hath ensued.

                        <p>To insert the Geography of the Israelitish Tribes, vvould be as bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome both to the reader and my self, as needlesse unto either. But the manner how the Tribes became local, was through the distribution of the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> by lot and intayling; the lands so distributed, unto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors and their heirs for ever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out power of alienation, in any such manner as to deprive their posterity. The lot or ballot in Israel was especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of three uses; one for election of magistrates, another for the discovery of some secret malefactor, and a third for the division of lands: to which three heads I hope to reduce the vvhole history of the government: and this work once performed, it will be easie to represent the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth in her Political method.</p>
                        <p>To begin with the election of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, it vvas performed sometimes by the lot, without suffrage; and sometime by the ballot, that is, by a mixture of lot and suffrage. For the clearer discovery of the order in ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:199326:40"/> I must invert the order of the Magistrates elected, and begin with the King; then proceed unto the Judge, and come last of all unto the Sanhedrim, and the inferiour courts.</p>
                        <p>The instruments used upon these occasions, were first lots, some blanks and some prizes: then Urnes (that is, pots) into vvhich these lots were cast, and out of which they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards drawn, or <hi>given forth;</hi> by what officers, or with what farther solemnity, doth not appear.</p>

Now supposing this law to have been in the vvhole, and methodically exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, the <hi>Canaanites</hi> must first have been totally rooted out of the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> which land, in that case (as some affirm) vvould have afforded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Commonwealth a root, or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,<note place="margin">Hecateus apud Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph. cont.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:199326:49"/> each with her suburbs, of four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand cubits diameter) one hundred thousand acres; and yet for extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary donations, as to <hi>Joshua,</hi> and <hi>Caleb,</hi> (of which kind there were but few) some eighty thousand acres might remain. Now it is true, four acres to a man may seem but a small lot; yet the <hi>Roman</hi> people, under <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus,</hi> and long after, had but two: and it may very well be, that one acre in <hi>Canaan,</hi> was vvorth two in <hi>Italy,</hi> especially about <hi>Rome;</hi> and four in <hi>England,</hi> though of the best sort: and if so it were, that four acres in <hi>Palestine</hi> vvere vvorth sixteen of our best; such a lot, at our account, might be worth some thirty or forty pounds a year; which for a popular share, holding that rate through the whole body of a people, was a large proportion. By this estimate, or vvhat possibly could be allow'd unto the princes of the Tribes, and of the families, their share came not unto a sixth of the vvhole: so the rest remaining unto the people, the balance of this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must have been purely popular. It is true, that in the vvhole, this law of <hi>Moses</hi> for the division of the land,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:199326:50"/> vvas never executed. But that in the parts, some like course was taken, is plain; for example, in the division un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to seven Tribes, vvhere <hi>Joshua</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth unto the people in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:<note place="margin">Josh. 18.4.</note>
                           <hi>Give out from among you three men for each Tribe— and they shall go through the land and describe it.</hi> The people having resolved accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, these <hi>went, and passed through the land, and described it by cities, into seven parts, in a book, and came again to Joshua, to the host at Shiloh. And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord: and there</hi> Joshua <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions.</hi> It were absurd to think that this lot determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of proportions; for so a mean man might have come to be richer then the Prince of his Tribe; but the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions allotted unto Tribes, being sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though at first but by guesse, and entred into the lot-book of the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyours, (vvho, saith <hi>Josephus,</hi> were most expert in Geometry) the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces came first unto the urnes, whereof the one contained the names of the Tribes that vvere to draw; the other, the names of those parcels of land
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:199326:50"/> that vvere to be drawn first unto a vvhole Tribe. Thus the name of a Tribe, for example, <hi>Benjamin,</hi> being drawn out of one urne, unto that name a parcel vvas drawn out of the other urne; for example, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try lying between <hi>Jericho</hi> and <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aven.</hi> This being done, and the Prince of the Tribe having chosen in vvhat one place he would take his stated and agreed proportion, vvhether of fourteen thousand acres, or the like; the rest of the Country vvas subdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the lot-book, according to the number of families in the Tribe of this Prince; and the parcels subdivided, being cast into the one urne, the names of the Patriarches into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the same Tribe came again by families: thus every Patriarch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king choice in vvhat one part of this lot he vvould take his agreed propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vvhether of four thousand acres, or the like; the remainder vvas again subdivided in the lot-book, according to the number of names in his family: if they vvere more then the parcel vvould furnish, at four acres a man, then vvas that defect amended by addition out of the next parcel:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:199326:51"/> and if they were fewer, then the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus vvas cast unto the next parcel.

Keep therefore, and do them: for this is your wisdom, and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say; Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this great nation is a wise and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing people.</hi> In another place, upon the peoples observing this form, he pronounceth all the choicest bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings; and in case of violation of the same, a long enumeration of most dreadfull curses, amongst which he hath this:<note place="margin">Deut. 28.36.</note>
                           <hi>The Lord shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation, which neither thou, nor thy fathers have known, and there
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:199326:54"/> shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.</hi> In which words, first he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the king upon the people, as a creature of their own; and next, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth his forme, point-blank unto Monarchy: as is farther apparent in the whole Antithesis running through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that Chapter. To the neglect of these orders, may be apply'd those words of <hi>David: I have said that ye are gods— but ye shall dye like men, and fall like one of the Princes.</hi> But this government can with no countenance of reason, or testimony of story, give any man ground to argue from the frame thus instituted by <hi>Moses,</hi> that a commonwealth, rightly ordered, and established, may by any internal cause, arising from such orders, be broken, or dissolved; it being most apparent, that this was never established in any such part, as could possibly be hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Moses</hi> dyed in the wildernesse; and though <hi>Joshua,</hi> bringing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into the promised land, did what he could, during his life, towards the establishment of the form designed by <hi>Moses;</hi> yet the hands of the people, especially after the death of <hi>Joshua,</hi> grew slack, and they rooted not out

                        <p>THe frame of that which I take to have been the ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, or representative of the people of Israel, is not perfectly shewn in Scripture, till the time of <hi>David;</hi> when, though it have nothing in it of a Monarchical institution, it is found intirely remaining, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly described in these words:<note place="margin">1 Chr. 27.</note>
                           <hi>Now the children of Israel after their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; to wit, the chief fathers, and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of thousands, and hundreds, and their officers that served the king, in any matter of the courses, which came in, and went out, moneth by moneth, throughout all the moneths in the year; of every course, were twenty and four thousand men.</hi> The polls of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as they have been hitherto shewn, were taken before their plantation in <hi>Canaan,</hi> where ere they had kings, they
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:199326:56"/> had grown (according to the account of <hi>Paul) four hundred and fifty years;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Acts 13.20.</note> during which time, that they were exceedingly increased, appeareth by the poll of military age, taken by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.9.</note> and amounting unto one million three hundred thousand: yet could this assembly of <hi>the children of Israel after their number,</hi> in one year, by monethly rotation, take in the whole body of them. How these, being a representative of the people, and thus changeable, could be otherwise col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, then by the monethly election of two thousand in each Tribe, is not imaginable. And that both a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative of the people they were, and thus changeable, is by the clear words of Scripture, and the nature of the businesse upon which occasion they are described, undeniably evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: for <hi>David</hi> proposing, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple resolving,<note place="margin">1 Chr. 29.22.</note> they make <hi>Solomon</hi> King, and <hi>Zadoc</hi> Priest. This assembly (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the military discipline thereof, in which it differed little from the customes of such other Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, as have been great and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial) had not onely a civil, but a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary office or function, as the stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:199326:56"/> guard, or army of this country: which, though small, and lying in the very teeth of her enemies, could thus, by taking every man in but for one moneth in a vvhole year, so equally distribute a burden, to have been otherwise intolerable unto all, that it might be borne by a few, and scarce felt by any one. This epitome of that body, already described, under the leading of the several Princes of the Tribes, with their Staves, and Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards of the camp, seemeth to have been commanded by Lieutenants of the Princes, or Tribunes of the respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Tribes.

                        </p>
                        <p>In this case, the Princes did not lead in person, but resided in their Tribes, for the government of the same; whence, upon extraordinary occasions, they sent extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits; or in case of solemn war, or some weighty affair, as the tryal of a Tribe, or the like, led up in person;

Whereupon, God being moved unto anger, admonished them by a Prophet, that in sparing the</hi> Canaanites, <hi>they had diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed him; and that in case they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted, for his mercies neglected, they should taste of his justice.

So this Commonwealth, which through the not rooting out of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> had never any foundation; came now to fail also in her superstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures: for proof whereof, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of Scripture is no lesse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant, in divers places.<note place="margin">Judg. 1.3.27, 29, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>The balance necessary unto King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly government, even where it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, or not absolute, is thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by <hi>Samuel: This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 Sam. 8.11, 14.</note>
                           <hi>He will take your fields, your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.</hi> That is, there being no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of this kind for a king, and it being of natural necessity, that a king must have such an Aristocracy, or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, as may be able to support Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; which otherwise, to a people having equal shares in propriety, is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:199326:61"/> altogether incompatible; it followes, that he must take your fields, and give them unto his servants, or creatures.</p>
                        <p>This yet could <hi>Saul</hi> not do, in whose time the Monarchy attained not unto any balance, but was soon rent from him like the lap of a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 8.1. 1 Chr. 11.</note> The Prince who gave that ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance unto this Monarchy, which it had, was <hi>David:</hi> for besides his other conquests, by which he brought the <hi>Moabites,</hi> the <hi>Syrians</hi> of <hi>Damascus,</hi> the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> the <hi>Amalakites,</hi> the <hi>Edomites</hi> unto his obedience, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his border unto the river <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates; he smote the Philistims, and subdued them, and took Gath and her townes, out of the hand of the Philistims.</hi> Now this country <hi>David</hi> thus took, was part of the land given unto the people by God, and which was by the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> to have been divided by lot unto them. Wherefore if this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision follow'd not, but <hi>David</hi> having taken this country, did hold it in his particular dominion or propriety; then though he took not from the people, any thing whereof they were in actual possession; yet, as to their legal right, took he from them (as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:199326:62"/>
                           <hi>Samuel</hi> had forewarned) <hi>their fields, their vineyards, and their oliveyards, even the best of them, and gave them unto his servants,</hi> or unto a nobility, which by this meanes he introduced.</p>

But however, these things, by advantage of forrain conquest, might be ordered by <hi>David,</hi> or continued for the time of his next successor; certain it is, that the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Monarchy in so small a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, must be altogether insufficient to it self, or destructive to the people.</p>

                        <p>To conclude this chapter with the story of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Kings: Till <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam,</hi> and the rent (through the cause mentioned) of the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his time, the Monarchy of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> was one; but came thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth to be torn into two: that of <hi>Judah</hi> consisting of two Tribes, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and that of <hi>Israel,</hi> consisting of the other ten. From which time, this people thus divided, had little or no rest from the flame of that civil war; which once kindled between the two realmes or factions, could never be extinguished, but in the destruction of both. Nor was ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:199326:64"/> War of so new a date among them; <hi>Saul,</hi> whole whole Reign was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and perverse, being conquered by <hi>David;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> invaded by his Son <hi>Absalom</hi> so strongly, that he fled before him. <hi>Solomon,</hi> the next Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour, happened to have a quiet Reign, by settling himself upon his Throne in the Death of <hi>Adonijah</hi> his elder Brother, and in the deposing of the high Priest <hi>Abiathar;</hi> yet made he the yoke of the people grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous. After him, we have the War between <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and <hi>Rehoboam.</hi> Then, the Conspiracy of <hi>Baasha</hi> against <hi>Nadab</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi> which endeth in the destruction of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> house, and the Usurpation of his Trone by <hi>Baasha,</hi> which <hi>Baasha</hi> happeneth to leave unto his Son <hi>Asa.</hi> Against <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi> riseth <hi>Zimri,</hi> Captain of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots; killeth him with all his kindred, reigneth seven days; at the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he burneth himself for fear of <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> who upon this occasion is made Captain by one part of the people, as is also <hi>Tibni</hi> by another. The next prize is plaid between <hi>Omri</hi> and <hi>Tibni,</hi> and their factions; in which <hi>Tibni</hi> is slain. Upon this success, <hi>Omri</hi> out-doing
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:199326:64"/> all his Predecessours in Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, leaveth his Throne and Vertues unto his Son <hi>Ahab.</hi> Against <hi>Ahab,</hi> driveth <hi>Jehu</hi> furiously, destroyeth him and his family, giveth the flesh of his Queen <hi>Jezebel</hi> unto the Dogs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth a present from those of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> even seventy Heads of his Masters Sons in Baskets. Unto <hi>Asa</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hosaphat,</hi> Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> belongeth much Reverence. But upon this Throne sat <hi>Athaliah;</hi> who, to reign, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all her grand-children save one, which was <hi>Joash. Joash</hi> being hidden by the high Priest, at whose command <hi>Athaliah</hi> was some time after slain, endeth his reign in being murdered by his Servants. To him succeedeth his Son <hi>Amaziah,</hi> slain also by his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. About the same time <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah</hi> King of <hi>Israel</hi> was smitten by <hi>Shallum,</hi> who reigned in his stead. <hi>Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> by <hi>Manahim,</hi> who reigned in his stead. <hi>Pekaha</hi> the Son of <hi>Manahim</hi> by <hi>Pekah</hi> one of his Captains, who reigned in his stead. <hi>Pekah</hi> by <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shea. Hoshea</hi> having reigned nine years, is carried by <hi>Salmanezer</hi> King of <hi>Assyria</hi> with the ten Tribes into Captivity. Now might it be expected
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:199326:65"/> that the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy peace: a good King they had, which was <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> but to him suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his Son <hi>Manasseh,</hi> a shedder of innocent blood. To <hi>Manasseh</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his Son <hi>Ammon,</hi> slain by his servants. <hi>Josiah</hi> the next, being a good Prince, is succeeded by <hi>Jehoahaz,</hi> who being carried into <hi>Egypt,</hi> there dieth a Prisoner, while <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becomes <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Tributary. The last of these Princes was <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> in whose reign was <hi>Judah</hi> led away cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi> Thus came the whole Enumeration of those dreadful Curses denounced by <hi>Moses</hi> in this case, to be fulfilled in this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; of whom it is also said, <hi>I gave them a king in my anger,</hi>

                        <p>But the Tribunes of the people in <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Romans under the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy of their Trubunes, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole administration of that Government, were never quiet, but at perpetual strife and enmity with the Senate. It is very true: but first, this happened not from a cause natural unto popular Government, but from a cause unnatural unto popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; yea, so unnatural unto popular Government, that the like hath not been found in any other Commonwealth. Secondly, the cause is undeniably discovered to have been consistent in a faction introduced by the Kings, and fostered by the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, excluding the suffrage of the main body of the people through an Optimacy, or certain rank or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, admitted not by the people or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:199326:66"/> their Election, but by the value of their Estates unto the Legislative Power, as the Commons of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So the State of this people was as if they had two Houses of Lords, and no House of Commons. Thirdly, this danger were in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nation, at least in ours, much harder to be incur'd, then Authors hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto have made it to be seen in this.

                        <p>Now as true as the <hi>Talmud,</hi> or as
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:199326:69"/> this word of a <hi>Scribe,</hi> or that <hi>Moses</hi> delivered the Oral Law unto the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Elders, and to <hi>Joshua,</hi> so true it is that <hi>Moses</hi> ordained both the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Elders and <hi>Joshua</hi> by the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of hands; and that this ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the imposition of hands, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Oral Law, came succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively, and hand in hand from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Elders, and from <hi>Joshua</hi> down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right unto these Doctors. This indeed is so clear in their <hi>Talmud,</hi> that there is no denying of it; but that as to the seventy Elders, it is quite contrary unto Scripture, hath already been made sufficiently apparent; for <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua,</hi> it is acknowledged that he was ordained by <hi>Moses</hi> with imposition of hands. But this Argument, besides that the Act of <hi>Moses</hi> was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with miracle, and that it is absurd to think that a thing plainly miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous should or can be received as an order in a Commonwealth, will go no step farther, then that <hi>Joshua</hi> upon this authority might have elected his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor by the imposition of hands: let them shew us then that he did so, or indeed that he left any successour at all: for certainly if <hi>Joshua</hi> left no suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:199326:70"/> so ordained, or no successor at all, which is the truth of the case, then descended there upon them no such Ordination from <hi>Joshua;</hi> and so by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, none from <hi>Moses.</hi> Whence it followeth, that the Authority and Vogue of Ordination by the impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands among the Jews, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not from the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> but from the Oral Law; which how bad an Authority soever it be unto us of right, is of fact, or of what the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Ordination was among the Jews, a good and sufficient testimony. Now thereby the condition of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination (though in some times of the Commonwealth it were less re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd) was such, that no man not having received the same from the great Sanhedrim, or some one of the inferiour Courts by laying on of hands, by word of mouth, or by writing, could be a Presbyter, or capable of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Judicature or Magistracy in the Commonwealth, or to give counsel in the Law, or any part of the Law, or to be of the assembly of the great Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue.</p>

                        <p>VVhat the assembly of the Princes and Fathers was in the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi>
                           <pb n="85" facs="tcp:199326:70"/> hath been shewn, and is left unto judgement. But this is that which the Talmudists and their Ancestors the Cabalistical Jews, among vvhich the Pharisees were of the highest rank, unanimously affirm to have consisted of the seventy Elders, and of a Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta of fifty Presbyters not elected by the people, but by the laying on of hands by the Sanhedrim, or by some other Judicatory. This, they say, was the institution of their great Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue; where I leave them: but that according to the sense wherein they cite their Authority, the like with them was the constant practice, appeareth not onely by their own Testimony and Records, but is plain in Scripture; as where Christ speaketh of the Jews unto his Apostles in this manner:<note place="margin">Grot. ad Mat. 10.17.</note>
                           <hi>They will scourge you in their Synagogues;</hi> that is, the Jews, having as yet not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Law made whereby they can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the liberty of conscience, or bring you for the practice thereof un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to punishment, will call their great Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, wherein the Priests and the Pharisees, or the Sanhedrim, have at least seven to five the over-ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancing vote unto the rest; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:199326:71"/> are their creatures, and by these will easily carry or make such Laws where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may inflict upon you corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral punishment: which interpretation of Christs words, was fulfilled even unto a tittle, or rather with over-mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. For upon this occasion the high Priest,<note place="margin">Act. 4.6.</note> and <hi>as many as were of the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.</hi> That this same Juncta to be in this case added unto the Sanhedrim, was to consist but of fifty, those fifty not elected by the people, but chosen by the Elders of the Sanhedrim; and not out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the people, but out of such one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as had received Ordination by the Sanhedrim, or by some other Court, or indeed were actually Judges in some other Court, was not enough, unless they might consist also of <hi>as many as were of the kindred of the high Priest.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Act. 5.21.</note> VVhich Rights and Priviledges being all observed, <hi>The high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the Sanhedrim, and all the Presbytery of the Children of Israel:</hi> that is, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, as being assembled in the great Synagogue, represented <hi>all the Presbytery of the Children of Israel,</hi>
                           <pb n="87" facs="tcp:199326:71"/> or all the children of <hi>Israel</hi> themselves. In this assembly you have the full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the great Synagogue: and <hi>when</hi> (in this Synagogue) <hi>they had beaten</hi> the Apostles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John, they commanded them that they should not speak in the Name of Jesus,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Act. 5.40.</note>
                           <hi>and let them go.</hi> Upon these proceedings, there are considerations of good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; as first, that the Cabalisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Doctors themselves did never so much as imagine that <hi>Moses</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the Sanhedrim alone, or separate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered from the people, with Legislative power; nevertheless, that the Sanhedrim came into the place, and succeeded unto the whole power of <hi>Moses,</hi> they unanimously held: whence, even upon their principles, it must follow, that in <hi>Moses</hi> distinctly and separately taken from the people, there could be no power of making a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Law. The second thing remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable in this proceeding, is, That the most corrupt Commonwealth, and in her most corrupt age, had not yet the face, without some blind, to pretend unto Legislative power in a single Council. The last I shall observe, is, That no possible security is to be given
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:199326:72"/> unto liberty of conscience, but in the security of civil liberty, and in that onely, not by Laws which are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise as perishing as flowers or fruits, but in the roots or fundamental orders of the Government. What even in these times must have followed as to the liberty of conscience, had there been an equal representative of the people, is apparent, in that <hi>the captain and the officers</hi> imployed by this Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue to apprehend the Apostles,<note place="margin">Act. 5.26.</note>
                           <hi>brought them without violence; for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.</hi> It is true, there is nothing with us more accustomary, even in the solemnest places, and upon the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnest occasions, then to upbraid the people with giddiness, from the <hi>Hosan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> and the <hi>Crucifige</hi> of the Jews. VVhat may be charged upon a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude not under orders, the fouler crime it be, is the fairer argument for such orders as where they have been once established, the people have not been guilty of such crimes: at least, it should seem, that in this case there is great scarcity of witnesses against them, seeing the Death of <hi>Socrates</hi> is more laid unto one people, then
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:199326:72"/> that of all the Martyrs unto Kings; yet were the false witnesses by whom <hi>Socrates</hi> suffered, (and by the like whereunto a man in the best Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may chance to suffer) no sooner discovered, then they were destroyed by the people, who also erected a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue unto <hi>Socrates.</hi> And the people who at the arraignment of Christ, cryed, <hi>Crucifie him, crucifie him,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Mark 15.11. Mat. 21.</note> were such as the chief Priests moved or prompted, and such also as <hi>feared the multitude:</hi> now that the people which could be prompted by the chief Priests, or the people which could fear the people, could be no other then this preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded representative of the people, but indeed Juncta of cousins and retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is that, which for ought I know, may be possible; and the rather, for what happened before upon the Law called among the Jews <hi>The Law of the Zealot,</hi> which was instituted by <hi>Moses</hi> in these words: <hi>If thy brother,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Deut. 13.6</note>
                           <hi>the son of thy mother—entice thee, saying, Let us go and serve other gods—thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death—and afterwards the hand of all the people.</hi> By this Law it is plain, that as to the true intent thereof, it relateth
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:199326:73"/> unto no other case then that onely of Idolatry. The execution of the same, according to the <hi>Talmud,</hi> might be performed by any number of the People, being not under ten, either ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the Party in the Fact, or upon Testimony of such VVitnesses as had so apprehended him; yet will it not be found to have been executed by the People, but upon instigation of the Priest; as where (they interpreting the Law as they list) <hi>Stephen</hi> is stoned. Now if the Priests could have made the People do as much against Christ, what needed they have gone unto <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> for help? and if they could not, why should we think that the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which cryed out, <hi>Crucifie Him, crucifie Him,</hi> should be other then the great Synagogue?</p>
                        <p>However, that it was an Oligarchy, consisting of a Senate and a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, which not onely scourged the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, but caused Christ to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is certain.

                           <hi>Stir up the gift of God which is in thee by the laying on of my hands.</hi> So the Ruler of a Jewish Synagogue did lay his hands also on the party ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is between the discourses of such as are commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led natural Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and those of Anatomists, large difference; the former are facile, the later difficult. Philosophers, discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of elements, for example, that the body of man consisteth of fire, air, earth and water, are easily both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood and credited, in that by common experience we see the body of man returneth unto the earth from whence it was taken. Like entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may befall the elements of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as in the first of these books
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:199326:84"/> they are stated. But <hi>the fearful and wonderful making,</hi> the admirable stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and great variety of the parts of mans body, in which the Discourses of Anatomists are altogether conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, are understood by so few, that, I may say, they are not understood by any. Certain it is, that the Delivery of a Model of Government (which either must be of none effect, or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace all those Muscles, Nerves, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and Bones, which are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto any Function of a well-order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Commonwealth) is no less then political Anatomy. If you come short of this, your Discourse is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ineffectual; if you come home, you are not understood: you may, perhaps, be called A Learned Author; but you are obscure, and your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is inpracticable. Now had I suffered in this, and not the people, I should long since have left them unto their humour; but seeing it is they that suffer by it, and not my self, I will be yet more a fool, or they shall be yet wiser. It comes into my head that I saw long since, upon an Italian Stage, while the Spectators wanted Hoops for their sides. A Country fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:199326:84"/> came with an Apple in his hand; unto which, in strange variety of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, his Teeth were undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly threatned, when entered a young Anatomist brim-full of his last Lesson, who staying in good time the hand of this same Country Fellow, would by no means suffer him to go on with so great an Enterprize, till he had first named and described unto him all the Bones, Nerves and Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which are naturally necessary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that motion: at which the good man being with admiration plainly chap-fallen, comes me in a third, who snatching away the apple, devoured it in the presence of them both. If the people in this case whereof I am spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, were naturally so well furnished, I had here learnt enough to have kept silence; but their eating in the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal way, of absolute necessity, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the aid of some political Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist; without which, they may have appetites, but will be chap-fallen. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples whereof they have had but too many; one I think may be insisted upon without envy.</p>
                  <p>This is that which was called <hi>The Agreement of the People,</hi> consisting
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:199326:85"/> in sum of these Propositions:</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Which Proposition putteth the Bar on the quite contrary side; this being the first example of a Commonwealth, wherein it was conceived, That five hundred thousand men, or more, might be represented by four hundred. The Representation of the people in one man, causeth Monarchy; and in a few, causeth Oligarchy: the Many, can be no otherwise represented in a State of Liberty, then by so many, and so qualified, as may within the compass of that number and nature embrace the interest of the whole people. Government should be established upon a rock, not set upon a precipice: a Representative consisting but of four hundred, though in the nature thereof it be popular, is not in it self a weapon that is fixed, but hath something of the broken Bow, as still apt to start aside unto Monarchy. But the paucity of number, is tempered with the shortness of term, it being farther provided,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That this Representative be bien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:199326:85"/> and sit not above eight moneths.</hi> But seeing a supreme Council in a Comonwealth is neither assembled nor dissolved, but by stated Orders di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting upwards an irresistable strength from the root, and as one tooth or one nayl is driven out by another; how is it provided that this Biennial Council shall not be a perpetual Council? whereas there is nothing more dangerous in a Commonwealth, then entire Removes of Councils; how is it provided that these shall be men sufficiently experienced for the management of Affairs? And last of all, whereas dissolution unto Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power is death, unto whom are these after their eight moneths to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath the Commonwealth? In this case it is provided,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That there be a Council of State elected by each new Representative, within twenty days after their first meeting, to continue till ten days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the meeting of the next Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative.</hi> In which the faults observed in the former Order, are so much worse, as this Council consists of few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Thus far this Commonwealth is Oligarchy: but it is provided,</p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:199326:86"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That these Representatives have Soveraign power, save that in some things the people may resist them by arms.</hi> Which first is a flat contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and next is downright Anarchy. Where the Soveraign power is not as intire and absolute as in Monarchy it self, there can be no Government at all. It is not the limitation of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign power that is the cause of a Commonwealth, but <hi>such a libration or poyse of Orders, that there can be in the same no number of men having the interest, that can have the power; nor any number of men having the power that can have the interest to invade or disturb the Government.</hi> As the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Commonwealths are more approaching to, or remote from this Maxime, (of which this of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers hath nothing) so are they more quiet or turbulent. In the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious part onely, proposing a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Religion and Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> though without troubling themselves much with the means, they are right in the end.</p>
                  <p>And for the Military part, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That no man (even in case of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion)
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:199326:86"/> be compellable to go out of the Country where he liveth, if he procure another to serve in his room.</hi> Which plainly entayleth upon this Commonwealth a fit guard for such Liberty, even a mercenary Army: for what one doth of this kind, may and (where there is no bar) will be done by all: so every Citizen by money procuring his man, procures his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. Now if this be work of that kind which the people in like cases (as those also of <hi>Rome,</hi> when they insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted their Tribunes) do usually make, then have I good reason not onely to think, but to speak it au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly, That to sooth up the people with an opinion of their own suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in these things, is not to befriend them, but to feed up all hopes of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty unto the slaughter. Yet <hi>the Leveller</hi>

                  <p>But <hi>Railery apart,</hi> we are not to think it hath been for nothing that the wisest Nations have in the formation of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as much relyed upon the invention of some one man, as upon themselves: for whereas it cannot be too often inculcated, that Reason consisteth of two parts; the one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, the other Judgment; a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or an Assembly are not more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the matter of Judgment, then voyd of Invention. Nor is there in this any thing at all against the suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of a people in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a proper form, being once introduced, though they should never come to a perfect understanding of it. For were the bodies of the people such as they could commonly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, they would be (as I may say) wooden bodies, or such as they could not use; whereas their bodies being such as they understand not, are such in the use whereof they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:199326:87"/>
                  <p>There are in Models of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, things of so facile use, and yet of so difficult understanding, that we must not think them even in <hi>Venice,</hi> who use their Commonwealth with the greatest prudence and facility, to be all or any considerable number of them such as do perfectly understand the true Reason or Anatomy of that Government; less is not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, in that not any of those <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> who have written hitherto of their own form, have brought the truth of it unto any perfect light. The like perhaps (and yet with due acknowledgement unto <hi>Livy</hi>) might be said of the Romans. The Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians had not the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of their Model, till about the time of <hi>Aristotle</hi> it was first written by <hi>Dicearchus</hi> one of his Scholars. How egregiously our Ancestors (till those foundations were broken which at length have brought us round) did manage the English sway, is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known. Yet by one of the wisest of our Writers (even my Lord <hi>Verulam</hi>) is <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelled which the Legislators of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Heroick times, for the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:199326:88"/> of those very lawes, which have now brought the Monarchy unto utter ruine. The Commonwealths upon which <hi>Machiavil</hi> in his discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses is incomparable, are not by him any one of them sufficiently explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or understood, much lesse is it to be expected from a people, that they should overcome like difficulties, through which the wisest nations fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themselves in necessity of a change, or of a new government, have usually done, by such offers as promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed fair, or against which they could find no exceptions, as men do by new clothes, that is, put them on, as such which if they be not exactly fit at first, will either fit themselves unto the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in wearing, or thereby more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew wherein they may be mended, even by such as would otherwise prove but bad workmen. Nor hath any like offer been thought to have more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, much lesse treason in it, then if one conscious of skill in archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, should make offer of himself unto the Prince or State to build a more convenient Parliament-house. <hi>England</hi> is now in such a condition, that he who may be truly said to give
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:199326:88"/> her law, shall never govern her; and he who will govern her, shall never give her law. Yet some will have it, that to assert popular power, is to sow the seed of civil war; and object against a Commonwealth, as not to be introduced but by armes: which by the undeniable testimony of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter experience, is of all other obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions the most extravagant; for if the good old cause, against the maw even of the army, and of all men well-affected to their country, could be trodden under foot without bloud; what more certain demonstration can there be, that let the deliberations upon, or changes of government, be of what kind soever shall please a Parliament, there is no appearance that they can occasion any civil war? Streames that are stopped, may urge their bankes; but the course of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> into a Commonwealth, is both certain and natural: the wayes of nature require peace. The wayes of peace require obedience unto lawes. Lawes in <hi>England</hi> cannot be made but by Parliaments. Parliaments in <hi>England</hi> are come to be meer popular assemblies. The lawes made by popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:199326:89"/> assemblies, though for a time they may be awed, or deceived; in the end must be popular lawes: and the sum of popular lawes must amount unto a Commonwealth. The whole doubt or hazard of this sequel remaineth upon this one question; Whether a single Council consisting but of four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, indued both with debate and result; the keyes of whose doores are in the hands of ambitious men; in the croud and confusion of whose ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the people are as carelesse as tumultuous, and easie, through the want of good orders, to be deluded; while the Clergy (declared and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate enemies of popular power) are there laying about, and sweating in the throng, as if it were in the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; upon whose benches Lawyers, being feathered, and aimed, like sharp and suddain arrowes, with a private interest, point-blank against the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, may and frequently do swarm, can indeed be called a popular Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. This I confesse, may set the whole state of liberty upon the cast of a dy; yet questionlesse is it more then odds, for a Commonwealth in often or long throwing, not through
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:199326:89"/> any certain run of Genius or Nature that can be in such a Council, but through the impotence of such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions as can go awry, and the external force or state of propriety now fully introduced, whence such a Council may wander, but never find any rest or settlement, save onely in that natural and proper form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which is to be erected upon a meer popular Foundation. All other ways of proceeding must be void, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably guilty of contradiction in the Superstructures unto the Foundation; which hath amounted, &amp; may amount unto discouragement of honest men, but with no other success then to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyl or retard business; <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not capable of any other perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent form then that onely of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, though her supreme Council be so constituted, that it may be Monarchically inclined. From this contradiction in the frame, is the frequent rise of contradictory Expostulations and Questions. How, say they, should we have a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth? Which way is it possible that it should come in? And how, say
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:199326:90"/> I, can we fail of a Commonwealth? What possibility is there that we should miss of it?</p>
                  <p>If a man answer, he answers thus: No Army ever set up a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. To the contrary, I instance in the Army of <hi>Israel</hi> under <hi>Moses;</hi> in that of <hi>Athens</hi> about the time of <hi>Alcibiades;</hi> in that of <hi>Rome</hi> upon the expulsion of the <hi>Tarquins;</hi> in those of <hi>Switz</hi> and of <hi>Holland.</hi> But, say they, other Armies have not set up Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths. True, indeed, divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Armies have not set up Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths: yet is not that any Argument why our Armies should not. For in all Armies that have not set up Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, either the Officers have had no fortunes or estates at all, but immediately dependent upon the meer will of the Prince, as the Turkish Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and all those of the eastern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: or the Officers have been a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility commanding their own Tenants. Certain it is, That either of these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies can set up nothing but Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. But our Officers have not estates of noble-men, able upon their own Lands to levy Regiments, in which case they would take home their people to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:199326:90"/> plough or make Hay; nor are yet so put to it for their livelyhood, as to depend wholly upon a Prince, in which case they would fall on robbing the people; but have good honest popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar estates to them and their heirs for ever. Now an army where the estates of the officers were of this kind, in no reason can, in no experience ever did set up Monarchy. I but, say they, for all that, their pay unto them is more considerable then their estates. But so much more must they be for a Commonwealth, because the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must pay: and they have found by experience, that the pay of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is by far better then that of a Prince. But the four hundred being Monarchically inclined, or running upon the interest of those irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enemies of popular power, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and Lawyers, will rather pay an army for commanding, or for support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Prince, then for obeying. Which may be true, as was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged before, in the way; but in the end, or at the long run, for the reasons mentioned, must be of none effect.</p>
                  <p>These arguments are from the Cause; now for an argument to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:199326:91"/> Sense, and from the effect: if our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies would raise mony of themselves, or which is all one, would make a King, why have they not made a King in so many yeares? why did they not make one yesterday? why do they not to day? nay, why have they ever been, why do they still continue to be of all others in this point the most averse and refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory?</p>
                  <p>But if so it be with us, that nature runneth wholly unto a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and we have no such force as can withstand nature; why may we not as well have golden dreames of what this Commonwealth may be, as of the <hi>Indies,</hi> of <hi>Flanders,</hi> or the <hi>Sound?</hi> The frame of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth may be dreamt on, or proposed two wayes; the one notionally, in which it is of facile understanding, but of difficult practise; the other practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably, in which it is of difficult under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, but of facile use: one of these wayes is a shooing-horn, and the other the shoo; for which cause I shall propose in both, as first no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, thus:</p>

                  <p>Thus much may suffice to give im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely a notional account of the whole frame.

Here lyeth the whole difficulty; such things, as try them never so often, they cannot make hang together, they will yet have to be practicable; and if you would bring them from this kind of shifts, or of tying and untying all kind of knots, unto the natural nerves and ligaments of government, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable.

That any daughter being an Orphant, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving seven hundred pounds or upward in portion, may charge the State with it. That the State being so charged, be bound to manage the portion of such Orphant for the best, either by due payment of the interest of the same; or if it be desired, by way of

                     <p>That these Propositions bar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>source of a Monarchical Nobility, is their peculiar end: wherefore that this should hold weight of an Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in a popular Balance already introduced through the failure of a Monarchical Nobility, or through a level made not by the people, but by the Kings or themselves, were prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous. Yet upon this score (for I see no other) is there such Animosity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst like Laws, that wise men have judged it an Indiscretion in such as are affected unto popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not to temporize in this point, at least till a Commonwealth were first introduced. To which judgment I am by no means inclining: First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the whole stream of this kind of Government, is so clear and pellu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid, as abhorreth to have any thing in the bottom that may not appear at the very top. Secondly, because an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grarian,</hi> not brought in with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:199326:95"/> of a Commonwealth, was never yet known to be brought in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the introduction of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. And thirdly, because the change of Balances in States through the want of fixation, hath been so suddain, that between the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, and that of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> being under fifty year, the English Balance of Monarchical, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came popular; and that of <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lives of <hi>Scipio</hi> and of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius Gracchus,</hi> being also under fifty years, of Popular became Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.

                     <p>Upon the addition of this clause, it
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:199326:95"/> may be safely said of these <hi>Agrarian</hi> Laws, That they concern not any man living; and for posterity, it is well known, that to enact a Law, is no more in their regard, then to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a thing to their choyce, seeing they having the will, can no more be devested of the power to repeal any Law enacted by their Ancestors, then we are of repealing such Laws as have been enacted by ours.</p>
                     <p>To this it may be objected, That <hi>Agrarian</hi> Laws being once enacted, must have brought Estates unto the standard of the same, before posterity can come into the capacity to judge of them. But this is the onely means whereby posterity can come unto a true capacity to judge of them: First, because they will have had experience of the Laws which they are to judge of: And secondly, because they will be void of all such imaginary interests as might corrupt their judgment, and do now certainly corrupt ours.</p>

                     <p>To rise thus from true foundations unto proper superstructures, the first step from the Balance thus fixed into the Orders of a Commonwealth, is no otherwise to be taken, then by certain Distributions or Divisions of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whereof some are to be personal, and some local.</p>
                     <p>The first personal division of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is into Freemen and Servants.<note place="margin">Freemen and Servants.</note> Freemen are such as have wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to live of themselves; and Servants, such as have not.

                     <p>The nature of riches considered, this division (I say) into freemen and servants, is not properly constitutive, but as it were natural. To come unto such divisions as are both personal and constitutive, it is proposed;</p>

Now if Dictatorian power be indeed formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, yet this in the first place is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that the Council here offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for a Dictator, is of far safer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:199326:107"/> then what among us, hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hath been offered for a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; as namely, a Parliament, and a Council in the interim. For here is no interim, but all the Councils of the Commonwealth not only remaining, but remaining in the exercise of all their functions, without the abatement of any; speed and secrecy belonging not unto any of their functions, but to that only of the Dictator. And if this Dictatorian Council have more in it of a Commonwealth, then hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto among us been either practised or offered, by what argument can it be pretended that a Commonwealth is so imperfect through the necessity of such an order, that she must needs borrow of Monarchy, seeing every Monarchy that hath any senate, As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly or Council in it, thereby most apparently borroweth more of a Commonwealth, then there is to be found of Monarchy in this Council?</p>
                     <p>To dismiss this whole Senate with one Parallel:<note place="margin">The fifth Parallel.</note> The institution of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Elders in Israel (as was shewn in the second book) for their number related unto an accident, and a custom thereupon anciently introduced. The
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:199326:108"/> accident was, that the sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> who went into <hi>Aegypt</hi> were so many; these first governing their families by natural right, came as those families encreased, to be for their number re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and continued in tha nature of a Senatorian Council, while the people were yet in Egyptian bondage. So we having had no like custom, have as to the number no like inducement. Again, the Territory of <hi>Canaan</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted not to a fourth of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and in government we are to fit our selves unto our own proportions. Nor can a Senate consisting of four Senators, be capable of so many distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions as a Senate consisting of more. Yet we finde in the restitution of the Sanhedrim by <hi>Jehoshaphat,</hi>

That the Senate should have power to make Laws, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the Government unto a single Council; and Government by a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Council, if the Council be of the <hi>Many,</hi> is Anarchy, as in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the Roman people by Tribes, which always shook, and at length ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:199326:112"/> that Commonwealth: Or if the Council be of the <hi>Few,</hi> is Oligarchy, as that of <hi>Athens,</hi> consisting of the four hundred, who nevertheless pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to propose unto five thousand, though they did not.

                        <hi>This was indeed the form pretended in words by the four hundred: But the most of them, through private ambition, fell upon that by which an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligarchy, made out of a Democracy, is chiefly overthrown; for at once they claimed every one not to be equal, but to be far the chief.</hi> Anarchy, or a single Council consisting of the <hi>Many,</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tumultuous, and doth ill even while it means well. But Oligarchy, seldom meaning well, is a faction, wherein each one at strife to make himself, or some other from whom he hopeth for advantage, mars all. There is in a Commonwealth no other cure of these, then that the Anarchy have a Council of some few well chosen and elected by themselves to advise them; which Council so instituted, is the Senate. Or that the Oligarchy have a popular Representative to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance it; which curing both tumult in the rash and heady people, and all
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:199326:112"/> those corruptions which cause facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness in the sly and subtile <hi>Few,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mout unto the proper superstructures of a well-ordered Commonwealth; as to return unto the example of the Oligarchy in <hi>Athens,</hi> where the four hundred, whose reign being very short, had been as seditious, were deposed, and the Soveraignty decreed to a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Council of five thousand, with a Senate of four hundred annually e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective upon Coursers or Rotation. Of this, saith <hi>Thucydides,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. 8.</note>
                        <hi>Now first (at least in my time) the Athenians seem to have ordered their State aright, it consisting of a moderate temper both of the Few and the Many. And this was the first thing that after so many mis-fortunes made the City again to raise her head.</hi> But we in <hi>England</hi> are not apt to believe, that to decree the Soveraignty unto thousands, were the way to make a City or a Nation reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of wounds, or to raise her head. We have a loathing, we are sick of such thoughts. An Assembly of the People Soveraign! Nay and an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of the People consisting in the major vote of the lower sort! Why sure it must be a dull, an unskilful
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:199326:113"/> thing. But so is the Touchstone in a Goldsmiths Shop, a dull thing, and altogether unskilled in the Trade; yet without this, would even the Master be deceived. And certain it is, that a well-ordered Assembly of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is as true an Index of what in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is good or great, as any Touchstone is of Gold.</p>
                     <p>A council, especially if of loose electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, having not only the debate, but the result also, is capable of influence from without, of interest from within: there may be a formed, a prejudicated party will haste or cry you from the debate unto the question, and precipitate you upon the result: whereas if it had no power of result, there could remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same no more then debate only, without any byas upon, or diversion of such debate from maturity; In which maturity of unbyassed debate, lyeth the final cause of the Senate, and the whole light that can be given unto a people. But when this is done, if your resolving assembly be not such as can imbibe or contract no other inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest then that only of the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, all again is lost: for the result of all assemblies goeth principally upon
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:199326:113"/> that which they conceive to be their own interest. But how an assembly upon rotation, consisting of one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, where the vote is six to four in the lower sort, should be capable of any other interest then that only of the whole people by which they are orderly elected, hath never yet been, nor I beleeve ever will be shewn. In like distribution therefore of debate and result, consisteth the highest my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of Popular Government, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the supream law, wherein is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained not only the liberty, but the safety of the people.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Otherwise the people, beyond all peradventure, would elect so many of the better sort at the very first, that there would not be of the foot or of the meaner sort to supply the due number of the Popular Assembly or Prerogative Tribe; and the better sort being barred subsequent elections by their intervals, there would not be wherewithall to furnish the Senate, the horse of the Prerogative Tribe, and the rest of the Magistracies; each of which obstructions is prevented by this exception. Where by the way, if in all experience, such have been the constant temper of the people, and can indeed be no other in reason,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:199326:114"/> it is apparent what cause there can be of doubt who in a Commonwealth of this nature must have the leading. Yet is no man barred from any prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; only industry which ought na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally to be the first step, is first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by this Policy, but rewarded amply; seeing he who hath made himself worth one hundred pounds a year, hath made himself capable of all preferments and honours in this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Where a man from the lowest may not rise unto the due pitch of his unquestionable merit, the Commonwealth is not equal; yet neither can the people under the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations proposed, make choice (as some object) of no other then high-shoon; nor have they at any time been so inclining to do, where they have not been under such limitations. Be it spoken, not to the disparagement of any man, but on the contrary to their praise whose merit hath made them great, the people of <hi>England</hi> have not gone so low in the election of an House of Commons, as some Prince hath done in the election of an house of Lords. To weigh election
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:199326:115"/> by a Prince with election by a People, set the Nobility of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> by the Nobility of the old Monarchy, and an House of Commons freely cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by the Nobility of the new. There remaineth but the <hi>Quorum,</hi> for which it is proposed,</p>

Otherwise the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, so far as it is meerly ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, is in this part accomplished. Now as of necessity there must be a natural man, or a man indued with a natural body, before there can be a spiritual man, or a man in capacity of divine contemplation: So a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must have a civil part, before it can have a religious part. And if a

And how, in case of like tumult, should a party de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their liberty of Conscience, or indeed their throats from the whole or a far greater party, whithout keeping down or tyrannizing over the whole or a far greater party by force of arms? These things being rightly considered, it is no wonder that men, living like men, have not been yet found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Government, or that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment hath not been yet found without a national Religion; that is, some orderly and known way of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick leading in divine things, or in the worship of God.</p>
                     <p>A national Religion being thus proved necessary, it remaineth that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:199326:116"/> I prove what is necessary unto a nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Religion, that is, as to the State, or in relation unto the Duty of the Magistrate.</p>
                     <p>Certain it is, that Religion hath not seen Corruption but by one of three causes; some interest therewithal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated, some ignorance of the truth of it, or by some complication of both. Nor was ever Religion left wholly unto a Clergie that escaped these causes, or their most pernitious effects; as in <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath brought Ignorance to be the Mother of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and indeed Interest to be the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Religion. Now the Clergie not fayling in this case to be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, what recourse but to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate for safety? especially seeing these causes, that is, Interest and Ignorance, the one deriving from evil Laws, the other from the want of good educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are not in the right or power of a Clergie, but of a Magistracy. Or if so it be that Magistrates of bounden duty ought to be <hi>nursing fathers and nursing mothers</hi> unto the Church,<note place="margin">Isa. 49.23.</note> how shall a State in the sight of God be excusable, that taketh no heed or care lest Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on suffer by causes, the prevention or
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:199326:117"/> remedy whereof is in them onely? To these therefore it is proposed,</p>

We find not indeed that the Apostles either took or demanded Tythes; in which case the Priests who were legally possessed of them, might have had suspition that they, under colour of Religion, had aimed at the violation of propriety. But putting the case that generally the Priests had been converted unto the Christian Faith, whether would the Apostles for that reason have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned them to relinquish their Tythes? Or what is there in the Christian Religion to favour any such surmise? To me there seemeth to be abundantly enough to the contrary. For if the Apostles stuck not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Jews in a Ceremony which was of meer humane inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to introduce this, as they did Ordination by imposition of hands into the Christian Church; that they would, upon like inducement, have refused a standing Law, undoubtedly Mosaical, is in my opinion most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable. So that, I conceive, the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:199326:118"/> Law for Tythes in being, may or may not be continued, at the pleasure of the Law-givers, for any thing in this case to the contrary.

                     </argument>
                     <p>THe word <hi>Province,</hi> is with Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Authors of diverse sense: By these it is taken sometimes for Magistracy; as that of the Consul, which was called <hi>His Province:</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time for any Region or Country, in which a Roman Captain or General was commanded to make War; but especially for such a Country as was acquired and held by armes, or by <hi>Provincial Right.</hi> The word is of like diverse use in Scriptures; as where it is said,<note place="margin">Esth. 1.1.</note> That <hi>Ahasuerus reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over an hundred and seven provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> by which are understood as well the divisions of the native, as those of the acquired Territories. But where <hi>Tanais the Governour</hi> writeth unto the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> concerning <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Judea,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezra 5.8.</note> it is understood a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:199326:128"/> acquired and held by arms; which cometh to the usual signification of the word with the Romans, it being in this sense that the Governour <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> asked <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>what province he was,</hi> and came to understand that <hi>he was of Cilicia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 23.34.</note> then a Province of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire: and this signification is that in which I take the word through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Chapter.</p>
                     <p>The mighty load of Empire which happened unto the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> through the Acquisition of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and vast Provinces, is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Songs of Poets, and the Saw of more serious Writers attribute the weight which they say over-swayed her. But this Judgment, though in it self right, is not in the manner they take it, to be swallowed without chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For how probable it is that the succeeding Monarchy was able to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a weight in this kind, which the Commonwealth could not bear, may at this distance be discerned, in that the Provinces were infinitely more tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent in the reign of the Emperours, then in that of the Commonwealth, as having a far stronger interest through ambition of attaining unto
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:199326:128"/> the whole, to tear the Empire in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: which they did, while divers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces made divers Emperours, which before could not hope to make divers Commonwealths, nor to acquire safety by retreat unto a petty Government. But in this, the acquisition of Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces devoured the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> that she, not being sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fortified by <hi>Agrarian</hi> Laws, the Nobility,<note place="margin">Plutarch <hi>in</hi> Grach.</note> through the spoil of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, came to eat the people out of their popular Balance or Lands in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> by purchases; and the Lands that had been in the hands of the <hi>Many,</hi> coming thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nto the hands of the <hi>Few,</hi> of natural and necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence there followeth Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</p>
                     <p>Now that <hi>England,</hi> a Monarchy, hath been seized of Provinces, (one of them, while <hi>France</hi> was such, being as great as any one of the Roman) is a known thing; and that the Militia proposed by the present Model, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth all the causes of greatness that were in that of <hi>Rome,</hi> is to such as are not altogether strangers unto the former, no less then obvious. Now of like causes not to presume like effects,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:199326:129"/> were unreasonable. The safety there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the foregoing <hi>Agrarian,</hi> as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto proposed, or that Lands be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in their descent, must in this case be none at all, unless there be some stop also given in their Accumulation by way of purchase; lest otherwise the spoil of some mighty Province be still sufficient to eat out the people by purchase.</p>
                     <p>To submit therefore in this place (for ought I perceive) unto inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table necessity, it is proposed,</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>59.</hi> Additional propositions unto the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grarian.</hi>

                        <hi>That (great Commonwealths ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been overthrown by the spoil of provinces) an estate of two thousand pounds a year in land, be incapable of any Accumulation by way of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Donations and Inheritances will be fewer then to be dangerous; and as some fall, others will be dividing in their descent. But to resume the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course upon the <hi>Agrarian</hi> Laws, which because they were not till in this Proposition compleat, remains imperfect. That unto <hi>Agrarian</hi> Laws some standard is of necessity, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth plainly enough. This standard in a well-founded Monarchy, must bar
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:199326:129"/> recess; and in a well-founded Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth must bar increase. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that otherwise each of these policies doth naturally breed that Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which eateth out the bowels of the Mother: as Monarchy, by Pomp and Luxury, reduceth her Nobility through debt into poverty, and at length unto such a level with the people, upon which no Throne ever stood or can stand: such was the case of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under her latter Princes. And a Commonwealth by her natural ways of frugality, of fattening and coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering up of the people, is apt to bring estates unto such excess in some hands, as eating out the rest, boweth the neck of a free State or City unto the yoak, and exposeth her unto the goad of a Lord and Master; which was the case of <hi>Rome</hi> under her perpetual Dictators. But why yet must this standard of Land in the present case, be neither more nor less then just two thousand pounds a year? Truly, where some standard was of necessity to be named, I might as well ask why not this as well as any other? yet am I not without such reasons why I have pitched upon this, rather then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:199326:130"/> as I may submit unto the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Reader in the following Computation or Comparison of the divers effects or consequences of so many different standards, as by the Rules of proportion may give suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent account of the rest.</p>
                     <p>Let the dry rent of <hi>England</hi> (that is, at the rate a man may have for his Land without sweating) be computed at ten Millions: This presumed, if you set the standard at ten thousand pounds a year, the whole Territory can come into no fewer then one thousand hands. If you set it at five thousand pounds a year, it can come into no fewer then two thousand hands; and if you set it at two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds a year, it can come into no fewer then five thousand hands. It will be said, In which way you please, it will never come into so few hands as are capable of having it: which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: yet because the effects in their approaches would be such as may be measured by their extreams, I shall pitch upon these as the readiest way to guide my Computation. The Balance in a thousand hands might affect the Government with an hankering after
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:199326:130"/> Monarchy; in two thousand hands it might usurp it, so as did the Roman Nobility, and thereby cause fewd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Senate and the People. These not onely in the extreams, but with much of like nature in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</p>
                     <p>But letting these passe, as also the numbers or compasse necessary unto the rotation of such a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, none of which inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are incident unto the standard of two thousand pounds a year, as that whereby lands can come into no fewer then five thousand proprietors; we will suppose these standards to be each of them, as to the safety of the Government, indifferently practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p>Yet so it is upon the record of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and wise Authours, that the true cause whence <hi>England</hi> hath been an overmatch in arms for <hi>France,</hi> lay in the communication or distribution of propriety unto the lower sort; and for the same cause let it be considered, if the Commonwealth upon the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of two thousand pounds a year <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> must not necessarily be an overmatch in the potency of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:199326:131"/> her Militia for the other two. Such are the advantages, such is the glory of like moderation unto the publick. <hi>Money</hi> (saith my Lord <hi>Verulam) is like muck, not good except it be spread.</hi> Much rather in Popular Government is this holding as to land, this having upon the State a far stronger influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, at least in larger Territories, then money; for in such, money while scarce cannot over-balance land; and were silver and gold as plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful as brasse or iron, they would be no more, nor would land be lesse worth. And for private men, were it not that <hi>it is easier to fill the belly of a glutton then his eye,</hi> not only vertue, but the beatitude of riches, would be apparently consistent in a mean. But what need the Divine or the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, upon a Doctrine which is not to diminish any mans estate, not to bring any man from the customs whereunto he hath been inured, nor from any emergent expectation he may have, but regards only the generation to come, or the children to be borne se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years after the passing such a law? whence it must needs follow, that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the case this <hi>Agrarian</hi> be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:199326:131"/> it is unto our age as if there were none; and if there be no <hi>Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> it is unto our age as if there were one. The difference is no more, then that in the one way the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is at all points secured, and in the other she is left unto her fortune even in the main. Of such soveraign effect are like laws, that I would go yet farther, and propose,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That in</hi> Scotland <hi>the standard be set at five hundred pounds a year,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">60. Agrarian <hi>for</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>and</hi> Ireland.</note>
                        <hi>in</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>at two thousand pounds a year, in land; the rest for each as for</hi> England.</p>
                     <p>Narrownesse of an <hi>Agrarian</hi> for <hi>Scotland,</hi> being a Martial Countrey, would make the larger provisi n of a good Auxiliary Militia; and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of an <hi>Agrarian</hi> for <hi>Ireland,</hi> being lesse Martial, would cast a sop into the jaws of their avarice, who should think it too much confined at home. And lest the Provincials in this case should think themselves worse dealt withall then the Citizens themselves, the sum of the <hi>Agrarian</hi> Laws being cast up together, any man in the three Nations may hold four thousand five hundred pounds a year in land, and any small parcel of land,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:199326:132"/> or meer residence in <hi>England,</hi> maketh a Provincial a Citizen. Should the Commonwealth increase in Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the estates at this rate both of her Citizens and Provincials, would be more and greater then ever were those of the ancient Nobility of these Nations, and without any the least hazard unto liberty. For he who considering the whole story, or that only of the <hi>Gracchi</hi> in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> shall judge aright, must confesse, that had <hi>Rome</hi> preserved a good <hi>Agrarian</hi> but in <hi>Italy,</hi> the riches of her Provinces could not have torn up the roots of her liberty, but to the contrary must have water'd them. It may be said, What need then of putting an <hi>Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> upon the Provinces? I answer: For two Reasons: first, indulgence to the Provincials, and then advantage to the Commonwealth. For the first, it is with small foresight apparent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that the avarice of the Citizen being bounded at home, and having no limits in the Provinces, would in a few years eat up the Provincials, and bring their whole Countries (as the Roman Patricians did <hi>Italy</hi>) to sound in their fetters, or to be tilled
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:199326:132"/> by their slaves or underlings. And so for the second, would by such means lose the Commonwealth an Auxiliary Militia, to be otherwise in <hi>Scotland</hi> only more worth then the <hi>Indies.</hi> These things therefore thus ordered, it is proposed,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That upon expiration of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy in the Senate,</hi>

                     <p>In modeling a Commonwealth, the concernment of Provincial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment comes in the last place; for which cause I conceive any long Discourse upon these Orders to be at present un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary: But certain things there are upon the by, which I am unwilling to let slip without pointing at.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Whethermen or money be the nerve of War.</note>Some will have men, some will have money to be the Nerve of War; each of which Positions, in the proper case, may be a Maxime: for if <hi>France,</hi> where the main body of the people is imbased; or <hi>Venice,</hi> which standeth upon a Mercenary Militia, want mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, they can make no War. But it hath heretofore been otherwise with Commonwealths. Roman Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians (as is observed by <hi>Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi>) in their Military preparations or expeditions, make no mention of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, unless what was gained by the War, and brought home into the Treasury; as the spoil of <hi>Macedon</hi> by <hi>Aemilius Paulus,</hi> being such, as the people for some years after were discharged of their Tribute. Not that their Wars were made altogether without money; for if so, why should the people at any time before have paid Tribute? Or why, upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, were they excused? but that the money in which their Wars stood them, was not considerable in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of that which is requisite where money may be counted the Nerve of War; that is, where men are not to be had without it. But <hi>Rome,</hi> by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:199326:134"/> of her Orders, could have raised vaster numbers of her Citizens and Associates, then perhaps she ever did, though during the Consulate of <hi>Papus</hi> and <hi>Regulus,</hi> she levyed in <hi>Italy</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, seventy thousand Horse, and seven hundred thousand Foot. Should we conceive the Nerve of this Motion to have been money, we must reckon the Indies to have been exhaulted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were found; or so much Brass to have been in <hi>Italy,</hi> as would have made stones to be as good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. A well-ordered Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth doth these things not by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but by such Orders as make of her Citizens the Nerve of her Wars. The Youth of the Commonwealth propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, are esteemed in all at five hundred thousand. Of these there is an annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Band, consisting of one hundred thousand. Of this one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, there is a standing Army consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of thirty thousand Foot and ten thousand Horse, besides such as being above thirty years of age, shall offer themselves as Volunteers; of which the number is no wise likely to be few. To the standing Army, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, or that onely of <hi>Scotland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:199326:135"/> both Populous and Martial, can afford at any time an equal number of Auxiliaries.</p>
                     <p>These Orders, thus summed up together, render this Commonwealth ordinarily able to wage War with fourscore thousand men; a Force, which it is known, not any Prince in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom is able to match in Vertue, Number or Discipline. For these, the Commonwealth in her Sea-guard hath always at hand sufficient waftage, or at least such a sufficient Convoy as may make any Vessels at hand a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient wastage; all this, I say, by vertue of Orders: not but that the March, the Eguipage, the Waftage of so great an Army must cost money, but that it will come to no account in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a lingring War made by a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of thirty thousand Mercenaries, the very consumption of a State; whereas fourscore thousand men so disciplined and so furnished, as hath been shewn, being once transported, must suddainly come to be no charge, or make the War defray it self.</p>
                     <p>But to reckon upon such a Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, were to suppose a large Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try capable of being a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;

                     <p>It is a wonder how the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> which held as it were the whole World by Provinces, should be imagined by any man to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted but of one Town or City.</p>

The Provinces of <hi>Venice</hi> and of <hi>Switz,</hi> would not change their condition with the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the best Prince. However,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:199326:136"/> the possibility in a Commonwealth of tyrannizing over Provinces, is not to be cured; for be the Commonwealth or the Prince, a State or a Man after Gods own heart, there is no way of holding a Province but by arms.</p>

                        <head>Sect. 1. That a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth not rightly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is yet less sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then the best of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies.</head>
                        <p>FOr a Nation to be still upon the cast of a Dye, to be ever in trepidation as to the main chance of Government, is a dreadful state of things. Such indeed with us hath been the Constitution of late Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, of which therefore not any can be called a Commonwealth. Yet hath the like state of things, in favour of Monarchs, and through the industry of the Clergy, been for many ages, that whereof Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths unheard, are still accused and condemned. For proof in this case, the Tribunitian storms of the Roman peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are thought abundantly sufficient.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:199326:138"/> But these having been without blood, if with our affairs they hold any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, are not to be compared with the Barons Wars, those of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> or the like; but with the contests or strivings of our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with their Kings, while such strife came not unto arms. Or if the Roman fields from the time of the <hi>Gracchi</hi> grew bloody, we have known a matter of a dozen years, in which ours might have compared with them.

                        <p n="1">1. <hi>It must be wholly void of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction or inequality.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>It must be such in which no num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men having the interest, can have the power or strength: and no number of men having the power or strength, can have the interest to invade or disturb the Government.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is not in Nature that there should be an effect, where there is not the cause of that effect; and in a frame of Government that is exactly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto the foregoing Maximes, there can be no cause of sedition or dissolution. A Model of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therefore that will hold exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by these Maximes, must (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:199326:139"/> oftentation, or with Mr. <hi>Wrens</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience) be perfect.</p>
                        <p>Now let us observe how he bestir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himself to examine and confute this Model. As to contradiction, he doth not so much as pretend that there is any guile in it; yet will not allow it to have any truth: <hi>For,</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">VV. p. 78.</note>
                           <hi>as in a fiction the several members may be so contrived, as not to give one another the lye, but be all contained within the limits of verisimilitude, and yet the whole remain without the least syllable of truth; so in a Model of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> To which I answer, That there being a truth of Nature, and a truth of Fact, this way of Mr. <hi>Wrens</hi> dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is meer equivocation. For the Model is not proposed to shew the truth of Fact, or that there hath been any such exactly in practice; but to shew the truth of Nature, or that such a Model is practicable: wherefore he needeth not to have alledged that it hath not the truth of Fact, which we all know; but was to shew where it faileth of such truth in Nature as can any way render it impracticable. But instead of this, he is gone to the Moon; and will read us a Lecture in Politicks,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:199326:140"/> by the Planets, or various Hypotheses of Celestial motions, <hi>which may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitated including no absurdity in themselves,</hi>

                           <hi>and yet perhaps not any one of them prove to be the true method of nature.</hi> But may a man therefore ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue in this manner: It is very hard to know certainly which are the high-waies of the Planets, therefore there can be no certain knowledge which are the high-waies to <hi>London?</hi> Let us e'en say, Because the rotation of the World may as well go upon the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens as upon the earth, therefore a man may as well go upon his head as upon his heels, and a Commonwealth as well stand upon a Milk-womans pattins as upon the strongest interest, or the interest of the strongest.</p>

                           <note place="margin">W. p. 179.</note>So much for contradiction. Now for inequality, saith Mr. <hi>Wren, Though it should be allowed Mr.</hi> Harrington, <hi>that his Commonwealth hath none in it, yet would it fail of attaining the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Government, seeing there is an inequality in the nature of man, which is not rectified by the Model of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</hi> As if the equality of a Government pretended to be such, as should make a crooked man
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:199326:140"/> straight, a wicked man good, or a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate man a Philosopher; and were not perfect in being sufficient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any influence, that wickedness, or passion in a man, or in men, may have upon the Government. But for far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther discovery of these inequalities in the nature of man, that are not recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Model, Mr. <hi>Wren</hi> sendeth us unto his eight and ninth Chapters, where he produceth them in such order, as I shall observe in repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him.<note place="margin">Pag. 84.</note>
                           <hi>Whensoever</hi> (saith he) <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Popular Government the number of those whose offences have rendered them lyable unto the severity of Laws, is considerable enough to qualifie them for attempt, Popular Government has no more security then any other, of being free from sedition.</hi> It is very true: but Mr. <hi>Wren</hi> was obliged to have shewn how in an equal Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, or under the Model proposed, it were possible that the number of such men should come to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enough to qualifie them for such attempt. But in this kinde he is no otherwise provided then to tell us, <hi>That of this Original and extraction, as to the main, was</hi> Catilines <hi>attempt upon
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:199326:141"/> the Roman Commonwealth.</hi> So under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking against <hi>Oceana,</hi> or the most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Commonwealth, he is come to arguing against <hi>Rome,</hi> or the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Commonwealth; and at such a time too, when being no longer capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of liberty, but ready for bonds, there were other parties besides <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines,</hi> and others besides such as were obnoxious unto the Laws, that lay in wait for her; as <hi>Pompey</hi> and his party, or at least <hi>Caesar</hi> and his, who at length carried it: so that this feat was not so much performed by men other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>lyable unto severity of Laws,</hi> as by men puffed up by ambition. But let these have been of which sort he will, it remains with him to shew, how there should be of either kinde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in <hi>Oceana</hi> for a like attempt. It is known that long before this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in <hi>Rome,</hi> the whole of that Commonwealth was in the hands of three men, <hi>Caesar, Pompey,</hi> and <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus:</hi> wherefore he should have first shewn, which way the whole of the Commonwealth of <hi>Oceana</hi> might come into the hands of three, or of a few men.

                           <hi>This Representative thinking it their interest, may dissolve the Government, and perpetuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and may come to think it their interest. For the desire of power being natural to man, a far greater share of power remaineth with every particular man, when the soveraign power is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded among so many, then when the same power is divided among two hundred thousand.</hi> But I shewed that this Representative hath the whole sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power in themselves, not divided with any other, or with the five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand; which I suppose he means by the two hundred thousand he mentions. Now this Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive cannot be understood to have the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:199326:142"/> soveraign power by over-balance of strength, because they are but one thousand, to five hundred thousand: so it is plain that they have it by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, or by orders only; wherefore these orders they have not the power, or strength, nor the interest to break, because breaking their orders, by which onely and not by strength the power is in themselves, they come to divide the power that was in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, with the five hundred thousand, as they who in defect of the orders have the far greater strength, and no legal bar. Yet saith he, <hi>That a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative is not uncapable of making such an attempt as this,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">W. p. 85.</note>
                           <hi>will (it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable) easily find belief with those who are acquainted with the actions of these last eighteen years.</hi> Which is as much as to say, That because a Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, by and with the people, may have both the interest, and the power or strength to free themselves of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Monarchy; therefore a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative may without and against the people, have both the interest, and the power or strength to break the orders of the most equal Commonwealth. But if the Representative of <hi>Oceana</hi>
                           <pb n="121" facs="tcp:199326:142"/> have not the power or strength to break their orders, and perpetuate themselves, much less the Senate. True it is, if we look upon some other Commonwealths, a Senate might have the interest to do it; but not where the Senate hath been upon rotation. To adde then unto Mr. <hi>Wrens</hi> faculty of opposition greater strength then is in it; if the Senate of <hi>Oceana</hi> would do any thing of this kind, their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest way were by creating of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator. The Dictator being created, hath soveraign power in carrying on the orders of the Commonwealth; but those do not perpetuate their power, this therefore cannot be done but by force or arms. The arms of the Commonwealth are both nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and in posture or readiness; but they consist of her Citizens: and for the Dictator to bring the Citizen to break the Commonwealth, were for a General to command his Army to cut their own throats. It is true, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Decemvirs</hi> put in for prolongati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but, though in the most unequal Commonwealth, could not make it stand one year. And for mercenaries there are none in <hi>Oceana:</hi> is this news?
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:199326:143"/> there were none in <hi>Israel,</hi> there were none in <hi>Athens,</hi> there were none in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> there were none in <hi>Rome,</hi> while those Commonwealths flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. But were there mercenaries, as he might perhaps reckon servants, they are unarmed, undisciplined; they cannot rise, through the vast bodies of Citizens in arms both Elders and Youth; or if they would rise, were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in their hands. The Roman slaves, and the Lacedemonian Helots being far of another, and more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous nature, never rose against their Lords, but to their own destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. All this while I say nothing of the security which is in the frame of this Dictator, beyond any example or interest of prolongation to be found either in the Roman Dictator or the Venetian Council of ten, each whereof having had like power, did never discover any such inclination. It is true, that in the time of <hi>Sylla,</hi> the Roman Dictator began to be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; but this is not to be attributed so much unto the imperfection of the order, as to the change of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance. But if the Dictator of <hi>Oceana</hi> cannot have the interest, or having
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:199326:143"/> the interest cannot have the power or strength to perpetuate that Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, much less can the Senate.</p>
                        <p>The summe of what hath been said, may be thus cast up, as to the whole constitution. If things or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that have neither the right nor the might, may prevail against things and persons who have both the right and the might; then may one order of this Commonwealth break the whole systeme: but the might through the foundation or popular balance of propriety being in the whole people, and the whole superstructures of this Commonwealth being nothing else but an equal distribution of common right unto the whole people, who are possessed of the might; they who have the might, have not the interest to break, but to preserve the orders, which therefore no other can have the power or strength to break, or some other breaking, must but lose that which they pretend to gain; the right which in this case must still fall unto the might, devolving upon the people. That Mr. <hi>Wren</hi> will needs fancie the Tribes or Cities in <hi>Oceana,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">W. p. 87.</note> as those in the united Provinces, or

And what can I help that, if it ought neverthelesse so to be, for a reason which he cannot answer? Nay, if so it be in common practice where the reason is nothing neer so strong, seeing a Parish Clerk, a Scrivener, an Apothecary; nay a Cobbler or a Farrier, is not uncapable of being of the Common-Council, nor yet of being an Alderman or Lord Maior of <hi>London;</hi> which neverthelesse that a Divine, a Lawyer, or a Physician should be, were absurd to think. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have a plough from which they ought not to look back: they have above a tenth of the Territory, with which they ought to be contented; and more then all, civil interest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by a Clergy, corrupts Religion. For Lawyers, their practice and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracies are not onely the most gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but for life; and in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, neither is accumulation of Magistracie just or equal, nor the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:199326:145"/> of executive and legislative Magistracie safe. Will Mr. <hi>Wren</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve one of our own Lawyers, and one of the learnedst of them upon this point?<note place="margin">Verulame de aug.

                     <p>Concerning an House of Peers.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>NOt a man knowing in what is of necessity unto the foundation or being of Popular Government, can hope or expect the introduction of any such form, where Monarchy is not impracticable. They, where Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy is impracticable, who come first to discover it, and be convinced of it, if reason be not altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, are inevitable leaders. Hence it is that our Commonwealths-men are already renowned throughout this Nation, for their invincible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, even by confession of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, or such as proceed never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless in other waies. But where seed is so well sowen and rooted, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening possession and interests, are like such weather as holding back the Spring, but improves the Harvest; it may indeed be a chill season unto
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:199326:149"/> Commonwealths-men, but upon the Commonwealth must bestow fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation. Had our incomparable assertors of publick liberty, shot up before an universal eviction of the necessity which enforceth their cause, it must have been through such relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy, as would have made them glad to do things by the halves, which is the only rock to a rising Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, of scandal or danger; the whole being such against which there is nothing to be alledged, and the halfe such as is easily confuted. These things considered, what appearance is there, but it must redound unto the greater advantage of our Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths-men, that we are under a Vogue which abhorreth the very name of a Commonwealth? Seeing by this means one of two things must of necessity come, and come shortly unto publick view or discovery; either that Monarchy is practicable, or that it is not practicable; that is, in our state of affairs, or in this present distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the balance. If Monarchy be found practicable, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths-men are satisfied in their Consciences, and so ready in fair
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:199326:149"/> waies to return, and submit not only for wrath, but for conscience sake. But (let Divines cry Atheism, and Lawyers Treason) if it be discovered once unto common understanding that Monarchy is impracticable, then in cometh the Commonwealth, not by halves, but with all her Tackling, full fail, in her Streamers, and with Top and Top-Gallant.</p>
                  <p>The waies whereby it is at hand to be discovered whether Monarchy be practicable or impracticable, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially two; the one quicker, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther slower: the quicker way will be by work-men, the slower by the work.</p>
                  <p>If the work-men (being willing) be yet overcome by the meer obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their matter, it amounteth unto a plain confession, that Monarchy is impracticable. And if they give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Liberties of the People, they are overcome by the obstinacy of the matter; for that is not their work; nor any other work then such as must be void, not so much in regard of it self, though that may be true enough, as through the want of any other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity then what the Prince had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:199326:150"/> that is, an Army; and such an Army the nature whereof, for securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is none at all, but the contrary, as hath been shewn already:<note place="margin">Book 3. p. 16, 17, 18.</note> nor to be altered with better success then theirs, who became Princes in Grecian and Sicilian States.</p>
                  <p>But if the work-men give not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Liberties of the People, then must they so bound their Prince, that he can in no wise invade those Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and this by any other means then the full &amp; perfect introduction of a well-ordered Commonwealth, they will find to be utterly impossible: so either way they are overcome by the meer obstinacy of their matter.</p>
                  <p>If through secret dictate, (as when the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>Conviva Caesaris</hi>) or haste to make riddance, this be not perceived by the work-men, it will be but the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable by the work when it cometh to wearing or in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; and the flaws or grievances being found insupportable, the next Parliament, through the meer want of other remedy, must introduce a Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Good, and egregiously Prophetical!
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:199326:150"/> But what say you for all this, if we have an House of Peers, and that even for the Lords sake, there being no other way to secure the Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</hi> Why I say, if we have an House of Peers, it must be an House of old Peers, or an House of new Peers, or an House of the one and the other. Moreover I say, Let it be which you will, such an House may at some time, for some reason, be personally affected unto Liberty of Conscience; but is a constitution naturally averse, nay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto the Liberty of Conscience, and therefore can be no security unto the same, whether the Lords be Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual or Temporal, or partiparpale.</p>
                  <p>Lords Spiritual are inspired with a third estate, or share of a Realm, which giveth no toleration unto any Religion, but that only asserting this point, which is Monarchy. Setting this Oracle and some like reason of State aside, we may think that every Soveraignty (as such) hath Liberty of Conscience: this a King having, cannot give; and a People having, will not lose. For liberty of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is in truth a kinde of State, wherein a man is his own Prince: but
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:199326:151"/> an House of Peers sets up another Prince; it cannot stand without a King. If the Balance be in the Lords, as before <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, yet must they have a King to unite them, and by whom to administer their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if the balance be not in the Lords, they stand or fall with the King, as the House of Peers in the long Parliament; and the King fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, their Government devolves unto the People. Again, an House of Peers having the over-balance, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies somthing; in which case it hath not been known to be for Liberty of Conscience: and not having the over-balance, signifies nothing; in which case it cannot secure the Liberty of Conscience: thus an House of Peers, whether somthing, or nothing, is no way for the Liberty of Conscience, but every way for a King. And a King is a defender of the Faith. The faith whereof a King is defender, must be that which is, or he shall call his own faith; and this faith it concerneth his Crown and Dignity, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend against all other faiths. True it is, that a King for a step unto a Throne, may use what is at hand; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:199326:151"/> where there is Liberty of Conscience, to assert Civil Liberty by Scripture can be no Atheism; which lameth a Prince of one arm. But where liberty of conscience is not, or not perfect, Divines, who (for the greater part) are no fair Hunts-men, but love alife to be poa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, or clubbing with the secular arm; though if we (who desire no such advantages) might prosecute them for abusing Scripture, as they have done this thousand years, to all ends, intents and purposes of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, they would think it an hard case; yet not only brand assertors of civil liberty with Atheism, but are some of them studious in contrivances, and quaint in plots to give check or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move to this or that eminent Patriot, by like pretences or charges; which succeeding accordingly, by the power of a Parliament, they may have a Parliament in their power. Where there is no liberty of conscience, there can be no civil liberty; and where there is no civil liberty, there can be no security unto liberty of conscience: but an House of Peers is not only a necessary, but a declared
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:199326:152"/> check upon civil liberty; therefore it can be no security unto liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. And so much for this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
                  <p>Now to make upon the other parts proposed, and in a meer civil sense, some farther conjecture.</p>
                  <p>When an House of Peers setteth up an House of Commons, as in the Barons Wars, they will Govern the Commons well enough for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and not seldom the King too.</p>
                  <p>But we are to speak of a thing without any example, an House of Peers set up by an House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; nor, in the want of example, are we thought worthy to be furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with reason: so the guidance of our Discourse upon this point, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited unto Mother Wit, a notable Gossip, but not so good a Politician.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless if this House consist of old Peerage only, we have directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enough to know how that will be; for either the single person, or the commons will be predominant in the Government: if the Commons be so, then it will be with the Peers, as it was before their last seclusion; that is, while they do as the Commons would
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:199326:152"/> have them, they may sit; otherwise they are sent home: and if the single person be predominant, it can be no otherwise then by an Army; in which case the old Peers being not in arms, nor having any help that way, are as much under the Yoke as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: by which it may be apparent, that it is the great interest of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Peerage, that there be a well-ordered Commonwealth; otherwise the Commons being in bondage, the Lords whom that least becometh are but equal with them; and being free, the Lords are not the head, but at the foot of them; whereas in an equal Commonwealth, that the Nobility be not at the head, or have not the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, is quite contrary unto all reason and experience.</p>
                  <p>If the House consist of new Peers only, it must consist of the chief Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in the Army: which immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately divides the Government into two distinct Governments; the one in the House of Commons, whose foundation is the body of the People; the other in the House of Peers, whose foundation is the Army; which Army if it remain firme unto the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:199326:153"/> Peers, they not only command the Commons, but make and unmake Kings as they please, or as ambitious parties and persons among themselves are diligent or fortunate. But if the Army (as is most and more then most likely) come off to the Commons, the Peers are nothing, and the Commons introduce a Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>If the House consist of new Peers and old, the old Peers while they like it, are cyphers to new figures; and when they like it not, may go home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: Nor whether they stay or go, is this case so different from the former, as to be any greater obstruction unto a Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>To hate the very name of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, or not to see that <hi>England</hi> can be no other, is as if men were not in earnest. It is asked of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons what the Protector shall be, and he can be nothing but what they will. It is asked of the Commons what the other House shall be, and it can be nothing but what the Commons will. The Commons are asked whose the Army, whose the Militia, whose the Negative Vote is; nor can these be otherwise determined of then as they
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:199326:153"/> please. The Commons are asked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will make such a War, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will pay such a Debt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will advance such a Sum; all which are intirely at their discretion: therefore actually and positively <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is a Commonwealth. Nay, and that there remain not the least doubt, whether it be safe for any man to say thus much, the present Government hath either no legal denomination at all, or is legally denominated the Commonwealth: the question of the future state of it, cometh not one whit upon the matter, which is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy granted, but upon the form only. A Commonwealth for the matter makes her self; and where they will not bestow upon her the form neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, faileth not to ruine, or at least to disgrace the work-men. Or, to speak more properly and piously, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth is not made by men, but by God; and they who resist his holy will, are weapons that cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper.</p>
